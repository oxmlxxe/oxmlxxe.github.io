Hi! <br><br>

<u>Update 1 (08/16/15):</u><br>
In the final presentation I left out XXE attacks via XMP in PDF (gif, etc.) though it is still in the slide deck. This support is added in oxml_xxe. For example:<br>
<t>ruby oxml_xxe.rb --poc pdf --ip 192.168.14.1:8000

<u>Update 2 (11/19/15):</u><br>
Recently presented updated material as part of the <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/html/webcast/11192015-exploiting-xml-entity-vulnerabilities-in-file-parsing-functionality.html">Blackhat Webcast Series</a><br>
Additional material was added discussing XXE via PDF, GIF, PNG, and JPG. Updates have been pushed to the tool.<br>
